| Auth         | ASP.NET Core Identity + JWT       |
| Database     | SQL Server with EF Core           |
| API Testing  | Postman                           |
| Architecture | RESTful API with layered approach |

## üîê Authentication Flow

1. **Registration (`POST /api/auth/register`)**

   * User signs up.
   * Identity framework stores hashed password.
   * User assigned default role (e.g., User).

2. **Login (`POST /api/auth/login`)**

   * JWT is generated if credentials are valid.
   * Token includes claims such as role, email, etc.
   * Sent in `Authorization` header for future requests.

3. **Middleware**

   * Validates JWT on every request.
   * Populates `User.Identity` with claims.

4. **Role Enforcement**

   * `[Authorize(Roles = "Admin")]` used to protect admin-specific endpoints.
